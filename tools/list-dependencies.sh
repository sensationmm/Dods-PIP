# List all dependencies between projects.
# Poject is identified with relative path to project's root directory from repository root.
#
# Dependencies can be specified in text file where each line is path (from monorepo root) to other project.
# Default location of dependency file is in root dir of each project on path `.ci/dependencies.txt`.
# Location of dependency file can be changed by setting environment variable `CI_DEPENDENCIES_FILE`.
#
# Outputs lines of tuples in format PROJECT1 PROJECT2 (separated by space), 
# where PROJECT1 depends on PROJECT2.

# Usage:
#   list-dependencies.sh
